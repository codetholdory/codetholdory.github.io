Right, I've been meaning to do this for some time now.

Since the Covid-19 ([SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2)) pandemic began in the UK in early 2020 I have been interested in the growth of Covid across the world and in tracking the growth and waves of cases, hospital admissions, deaths and particulary child deaths within the UK.

Initially the media and Government were interested in making the public aware of what was going on in the UK, how to protect themselves and others, however, this protective approach soon disappeared, initially when the Government stopped its briefings, then when the media seemed to remove the word Covid from their collective vocabulary.

Prior to this I had started to communicate with the developers of the UK's [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) and decided to publish the daily Covid statistics through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codetholdory).

Doing this I joined a group of interested people on Twitter who were determined to publish the facts even if the Goverment and media had decided that we were to 'learn to live with Covid-19'.

I have received both critism and thanks for continuing to publish the statistics for Covid-19, however, the data has progressively reduced, it no longer covers the whole of the UK, it is now just for England, and currently is weekly rather than each weekday.

Anyway, in the interests of transparancy I have released the source code for these weekly [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codetholdory), and now [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@codetholdory) posts via my GitHub repository.

Please feel free to review, use for yourself, or comment.
