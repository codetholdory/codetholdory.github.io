I think now with the temporary morgues on car parks and gritting stores that the Governments policy is clearly to achieve the goal of weakening the Covid-19 virus by eliminating all those vulnerable to its effects.

It is clear that this policy has been discussed by leaders in both the West, predominantly the UK and US, and in the East, with China, and fully adopted as the only way they think of ending this pandemic.

This is traditionally the only way that viruses become weaker, either through effective vaccination e.g. polio, or by removing those with the disease from the gene pool, i.e. those with an innate lack of suspectability survive.

Unfortunately this is a dangerous and reckless approach with Covid-19, we have not yet identified those with innate protection, or if it even exists, it appears that everyone infected with increasing infections has a damaged immune system. It is likely, as with AIDS, that the true consequences will not appear for many years, and the death toll is likely to be truly staggering over time.

The bigger consequence is likely to be an increasingly disabled population, unable to work fully and be supported by the remaining workers.

This is what the Governments are afraid of, economic collapse, they have already started suggesting removing state pensions for those with private pensions, statins to deal with blood clots, privatizing the NHS, etc.
It is apparent that they do not have the answers yet and are desperately clutching at options to maintain some semblance of an economy and law and order, but they are losing and are willing to sacrifice millions in the process.

It is going to be a difficult few years until we either accept that the world has now changed and that we need to change the way we live and work, or science comes up with an effective solution to the problem, i.e. a sterilizing vaccine with close to 100% effectiveness.
You cannot rely on others to protect you and your families, it is now up to you.

Remember, Covid-19 is not over, it is not mild and it damages your immune system over time.
